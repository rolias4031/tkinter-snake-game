# tkinter-snake-game
The classic game Snake using the Tkinter GUI library

### How to Run Locally
1. Download this game folder and move it into your directory of choice.
2. Make sure you have the Tkinter, pillow, and random libraries installed.
3. Open up your terminal, move into the directory containing the snake_game.py file and type `python3 snake_game.py`. (These are Mac/Linux commands)

### Game Instructions
1. The game starts automatically, so be prepared.
2. Use the arrows keys to orient the snake.
3. Eat the purple squares and avoid the walls and the snake itself. The snake grows every time you eat a square.
4. Make the snake as long as you can.

### Upcoming Improvements
- One of my tasks is to add a home page that appears on game start/end. That way users can start the game at their leisure and play again without repeatedly closing the program and using the terminal.
- I want to add a settings page that allows the user to adjust the snake's speed.
- Farther down the line, I want to add a leaderboard feature. I figured I could do this by writing a player's name and score to a plain text file, whose contents could be displayed at the end of each game.
